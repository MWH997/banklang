# BankTS Language Specification

## 1. Design goal

BankTS is a restricted TypeScript-like language for banking workloads that compiles to COBOL.

It is intentionally less expressive than TypeScript. The goal is safety, auditability, and predictable COBOL generation.

## 2. Modules

```ts
module AccountTransfer;
```

A file may define one module. Module names must be stable identifiers. Generated COBOL program names are derived from module names using a deterministic naming strategy.

## 3. Primitive types

Supported primitive types:

```ts
bool;
int<digits>;
uint<digits>;
decimal<precision, scale>;
string<length>;
date;
time;
timestamp;
```

Examples:

```ts
type AccountId = string<16>;
type CustomerId = string<20>;
type Amount = decimal<18, 2>;
```

## 4. Currency types

Currency types are nominal and cannot be mixed implicitly.

```ts
type BDT = currency<"BDT", 18, 2>;
type USD = currency<"USD", 18, 2>;
```

Invalid:

```ts
let total: BDT = bdtAmount + usdAmount;
```

Valid:

```ts
let converted: BDT = fxConvert(usdAmount, rate, "HALF_EVEN");
```

## 5. Records

Records map to COBOL group items and copybook structures.

```ts
record TransferRequest {
  debitAccount: string<16>;
  creditAccount: string<16>;
  amount: decimal<18, 2>;
  idempotencyKey: string<36>;
}
```

Rules:

- field order is preserved
- field lengths are fixed
- nullable fields must be explicit
- dynamic object fields are forbidden
- nested records are allowed
- arrays must be bounded

## 6. Bounded arrays

```ts
record Statement {
  entries: LedgerEntry[1000];
}
```

Arrays must be statically bounded unless mapped to a known COBOL `OCCURS DEPENDING ON` construct.

## 7. Nullable values

Nullable values are explicit:

```ts
type OptionalBranch = nullable<string<8>>;
```

A nullable value must be checked before use.

## 8. Functions

```ts
function validateAmount(amount: decimal<18, 2>): bool {
  return amount > 0.0;
}
```

Restrictions:

- no closures in v0.1
- no generators
- no async functions
- no higher-order functions in v0.1
- recursion disabled by default
- every function has explicit parameter and return types

## 9. Control flow

Supported:

```ts
if
else
while
for each over bounded arrays
switch over enums
return
```

Unsupported in v0.1:

```ts
try/catch
throw
async/await
yield
```

## 10. Transactions

Transactions are first-class:

```ts
transaction postTransfer(request: TransferRequest) {
  debit(request.debitAccount, request.amount);
  credit(request.creditAccount, request.amount);
  audit("TRANSFER_POSTED", request.idempotencyKey);
}
```

Rules:

- transaction must have an idempotency key
- transaction must emit at least one audit event
- debit and credit totals must balance for ledger-posting operations
- rollback path must be representable in target backend
- generated COBOL must expose transaction boundary in source map

## 11. Audit events

```ts
audit("TRANSFER_REJECTED", request.idempotencyKey, {
  reason: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS",
});
```

Audit event names are compile-time strings. Audit payloads must be typed records.

## 12. SQL

SQL is declared explicitly.

```ts
sql selectAccount(accountId: string<16>): AccountRow {
  SELECT ACCOUNT_ID, BALANCE, STATUS
  FROM ACCOUNT
  WHERE ACCOUNT_ID = :accountId
}
```

Rules:

- host variables must be typed
- SQLCODE must be handled
- dynamic SQL is disallowed in v0.1
- generated COBOL must use explicit `EXEC SQL`

## 13. File declarations

```ts
file AccountInput sequential input record AccountRecord;
file PostingOutput sequential output record PostingRecord;
```

Rules:

- file status must be checked
- record type must map to a copybook-compatible layout
- generated COBOL must contain file-control and FD sections

## 14. Banned features

BankTS rejects:

- `any`
- `unknown` without narrowing
- `eval`
- object spread in data-layout records
- dynamic property access on records
- floating-point money
- implicit string-number coercion
- implicit nullable access
- prototype mutation
- ambient runtime mutation
- time-zone-dependent operations without explicit calendar/time-zone policy

## 15. Naming strategy

Source identifiers are converted to COBOL names deterministically.

Example:

```txt
validateAmount -> VALIDATE-AMOUNT
TransferRequest -> TRANSFER-REQUEST
debitAccount -> DEBIT-ACCOUNT
```

Conflicts are resolved with stable suffixes derived from source position and symbol table order, not randomness.
